## Linux on Windows (I call it Winux)

if you would like to unify your Linux and Windows q console based experiences, you might find C shell from Hamiltonlabs useful.

Steps:

1. download, install and run http://www.hamiltonlabs.com/Demo.htm 

2. to get a more familiar white on black experience, execute

    setenv colors= white on black

3. cd /q/w32           on Windows

4. q.exe -p 5001

  important: "q" is an alias for quit in hamilton c shell.  So make sure you type the ".exe" on the end.
