## Idea

if you would like to unify your Linux and Windows q console based experiences, this C shell for windows from http://www.hamiltonlabs.com/Demo.htm might be useful for you.

Steps:

1. to get a more familiar white on black experience, execute

    setenv colors= white on black

2. cd /q/w32           on Windows

3. q.exe -p 5001

  important: "q" is an alias for quit in hamilton c shell.  So make sure you type the ".exe" on the end.
